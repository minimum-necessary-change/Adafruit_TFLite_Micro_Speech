# Adafruit TensorFlow Lite Micro Speech Library [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TFLite_Micro_Speech.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TFLite_Micro_Speech)

This is a 'Arduino-ified' version of the TensorFlow Lite (experimental) micro speech example. Some changes were made to the generated Arduino project file, and then we built some examples on top of it. We require pressing a button to record audio that is then analyzed - there is no example for continuous record/analyze (yet)

The Arcada/Tron demo woks best with PyGamer or PyBadge but any other Arcada board will work. Other demos will work fine on a breadboard.

SAMD51 works best, we recommend running at 200MHz and -Ofast for perky performance.

Here's a video of it in action :)
